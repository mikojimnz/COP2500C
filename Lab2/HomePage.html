    <h3>Definition</h3>
    <p>A natural disaster is a major adverse event resulting from natural processes of the Earth; examples are floods, hurricanes, tornadoes, volcanic eruptions, earthquakes, tsunamis, and other geologic processes. A natural disaster can cause loss of life or damage property, and typically leaves some economic damage in its wake, the severity of which depends on the affected population's resilience (ability to recover) and also on the infrastructure available.</p>
    <p>Hurricanes are the most violent storms on Earth. They form near the equator over warm ocean waters. Actually, the term hurricane is used only for the large storms that form over the Atlantic Ocean or eastern Pacific Ocean.</p>

    <h3>Types of storms and how they form</h3>
    <p>The only difference between a hurricane, a typhoon and a cyclone is the location where the storm occurs. In the North Atlantic, central North Pacific, and eastern North Pacific, the term hurricane is used. The same type of disturbance in the Northwest Pacific is called a typhoon. Cyclones occur in the Sount Pacific and Indian ocean. If the wind speed is greater than 74 MPH, then it is considered as hurricane/cyclone/typhoon.</p>
