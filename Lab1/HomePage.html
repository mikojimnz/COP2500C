      <h3>Professional Carrer</h3>
      <p><strong>Roger Federer</strong>, (born August 8, 1981, Basel, Switzerland), Swiss tennis player, who dominated the sport in the early 21st century with his exceptional all-around game. His total of <strong>20 career men's singles Grand Slam championships</strong> is the most in tennis history. Federer, who started playing tennis at age eight, became Switzerland's junior champion when he was 14. In 1998 he captured the Wimbledon junior singles championship and secured the <strong>Orange Bowl junior tournament crown in Miami</strong>. The following year Federer made his debut on the Swiss Davis Cup team and became the youngest tennis player (at 18 years 4 months) to end the year among the world's top 100, finishing that season at number 64. Federer competed at the <strong>2000 Olympic Games</strong> in Sydney, advancing to the bronze medal match. The following year at Wimbledon he defeated Pete Sampras to reach the quarterfinals, and by the end of 2002 he was ranked number six in the world. In 2003 Federer won his first Grand Slam tournament title, at Wimbledon. The following year he captured his first
        <a href="https://ausopen.com/">Australian Open</a>
        and his first U.S. Open and defended his Wimbledon title. A gifted shot maker, he was victorious in 11 of the 17 tournaments he played in 2004 and finished the year ranked number one in the world. In 2005 Federer's numbers were similarly remarkable, as he won 11 of 15 tournaments, including

  <a href="https://www.usopen.org/">U.S. Open</a>
        . From July 2003 to November 2005 he also won a modern-record 24 straight finals. In majors, Federer has won a record <strong>eight Wimbledon</strong> titles, <strong>six Australian Open</strong> titles, <strong>five US Open</strong> titles (all consecutive, a record), and one French Open title. He is one of eight men to have achieved a Career Grand Slam. Federer has reached a record 31 men's singles Grand Slam finals, including 10 consecutively from the 2005 Wimbledon Championships to the 2007 US Open. Federer has also won a record <strong>six ATP Finals titles</strong>, 28 ATP Tour Masters 1000 titles, and a record 23 ATP Tour 500 titles. Federer is also the only player after Jimmy Connors to have won 100 or more career singles titles, as well as to amass 1,200 wins in the Open Era.</p>
